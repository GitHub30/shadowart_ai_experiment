You form one of twelve zodiac animals from the lunar cycle with your hands in front of your camera, and a neural network tries to recognize which animals you’re making. The experiment is built on Google’s open-source machine learning framework TensorFlow. We made this as an example of how you can use machine learning in fun ways––and to celebrate the ancient storytelling art of shadow puppetry. Watch the video below to learn how it works, and check out more",
